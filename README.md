open the code file in android studio

backend:
In terminal

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

frontend - mobile application:<br />
Click the start button at the top tool bar to start the frontend

Important: <br />
There is no .env in this repository, therefore the backend does not function if the code is cloned from github.
